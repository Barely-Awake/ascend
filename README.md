# Ascend

## Description

Ascend is a bot made by [Barely Awake](https://github.com/Barely-Awake)
that aims to be an **open source** alternative to many discord bots.

Some features that are planned:

- Basic Moderation Commands
- Leveling
- Auto Mod
- Logging
- Reports
- Twitch & YouTube tracking
- Reaction Roles
- Suggestions

And that's just some features planned. Keep in mind those features are
only **planned** and none of them are implemented right now. It's going to
take a while before they are, but hopefully it won't be longer than a
month or two. For updates on these features join the
[Support Server](https://discord.gg/PpdbKXKgT3)

## Self Hosting

Honestly, I'd prefer it if you just invited the instance of the bot I'm using,
however I understand wanting to host something yourself, so I'll still provide a guide.

### Requirements

The following are required to set up the bot:

1. Discord Bot
2. MongoDB Instance
3. Hypixel API Key
4. Anti-Sniper API Key

If you don't know how to set up a Discord bot or MongoDB, there are plenty of guides online,
so you'll have to look that up.

A Hypixel API key can be obtained by joining the Minecraft server `mc.hypixel.net`
and using the command `/api`.

An Anti-Sniper API key can be obtained by joining the
[Anti-Sniper Discord](https://discord.gg/antisniper) and reading `#âœ¨info`.

### Setting Up

1. Create a file called `.env` then copy and fill out the fields from the
   `.env.example` file.
2. Install modules with `npm install`
3. Compile with the `tsc` command or use `npm run build` if you're on Linux
4. Start the bot with `npm start`
