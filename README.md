# Ascend

Ascend is a bot made by [Barely Awake](https://github.com/Barely-Awake)
that aims to be an **open source** alternative to many discord bots.

Some features that are planned:

* Basic Moderation Commands
* Leveling
* Auto Mod
* Logging
* Reports
* Twitch & YouTube tracking
* Reaction Roles
* Suggestions

And that's just some features planned. Keep in mind those features are
only **planned** and none of them are implemented right now. It's going to
take a while before they are, but hopefully it won't be longer than a
month or two. For updates on these features join the
